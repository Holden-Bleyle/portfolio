            <p>When was the last time you visited a website? Likely, pretty recently (you're here, after all!). So... did you find what you were looking for? Whether you're a business, a non-profit organization, or just an individual looking to show off something you care about, a universal constant on the Internet is that people that visit your site want to get what they're looking for fast.</p>
            
            <p>Effective UX/UI design, standardized layouts, accessibility features, mobile-first design, search engine optimization: All of the features of modern web design center around the idea of your site visitors getting where they need to be, in the least amount of time.</p>
            
            <p>Personally, I'm passionate about UI design! It's one of my favorite aspects of Web Design, and it's something I want to help you create an effective solution for, so you can focus on delivering the information you want to your audience, instead of worrying about how.</p>
