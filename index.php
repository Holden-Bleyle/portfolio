            <h2>ACE IN THE HOLE MULTISPORTS WEEKEND</h2>
            <p>The Ace in the Hole project was part of my coursework in Integrated Web Design. In it, we responded to a simulated client's Request for Proposal, continuing contact with them as we built a site that met their needs according to an agreed-upon statement of work. This involved creating the wireframe for the design of the site; completing the HTML and CSS to create the site; writing the Javascript/Jquery that powered the site's navigation; and creating a functioning contact form using PHP and an SQL database.<br><br>

            <h2>WALK ALBINA'S BLACK HISTORY</h2>
            <p>The Walk Albina's Black History walk is an annual event hosted by a history class on the history of African Americans and their participation in the Portland community, offered from PCC. I was assigned the role of HTML/CSS designer for this group project, meaning that I coordinated with the UX/UI designer to bring their wireframe and color pallette to life, while coordinating with the Javascript and PHP designers to fit their systems into the site.<br><br>

            <p>Hey, Holden, this site doesn't look so good...<br><br>
                Well, yeah! Welcome to my Custom Wordpress Theme testing site. It's where I throw things together as I learn the intricacies of Wordpress! Originally, this site was meant to show basic competency in making a custom theme for the Advanced Wordpress course at PCC. However, I'd like to slowly transform it into a real Wordpress theme! (Maybe I'll start by making the borders not 5px thick... what's that for, me from six months ago?)<br><br>
