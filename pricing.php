            <h2>Are you hosting your own site? Just want something to establish a web presence? Don't need future support? That's my price!</h2>
            
            <p>I'm new in the industry -- I'm aware of the limitations that places on me. My portfolio isn't yet established, my references are few. So, until I have more experience, and am able to take on more complicated projects solo... your site, whatever it is, is $200!</p>
            
            <p>This will get you a proper Statement of Work, detailing what the product you're receiving actually is... a set of wireframes that detail what your site should look like... basic branding information as we work together on aspects of a site like color design and target demographic... and of course, the site itself, along with help setting it up on your own hosting solution, if you choose.</p>
            
            <p>If this offer interests you -- to present your art portfolio, to give your business an Internet presence, or to just... make a site, please contact me using the form on this very site! Thank you for your time and interest!</p>
