            <h2>ACE IN THE HOLE MULTISPORTS WEEKEND</h2>
            <p>The Ace in the Hole project was part of my coursework in Integrated Web Design. In it, we responded to a simulated client's Request for Proposal, continuing contact with them as we built a site that met their needs according to an agreed-upon statement of work. This involved creating the wireframe for the design of the site; completing the HTML and CSS to create the site; writing the Javascript/Jquery that powered the site's navigation; and creating a functioning contact form using PHP and an SQL database.</p>

            <h2>WALK ALBINA'S BLACK HISTORY</h2>
            <p>
                The Walk Albina's Black History walk is an annual event hosted by a history class on the history of African Americans and their participation in the Portland community, offered from PCC. I was assigned the role of HTML/CSS designer for this group project, meaning that I coordinated with the UX/UI designer to bring their wireframe and color pallette to life, while coordinating with the Javascript and PHP designers to fit their systems into the site.</p>

            <p>This text is talking about the third website that I will be displaying in my portfolio! However, it doesn't yet, since I still need to update it from a previous course, so I'd like to take this space to talk about the issues I already have with the site! First off, it breaks well before mobile resolution; I'm going to look into a revision to the way the images are displayed in the mobile format (probably shifting them to the top instead of the left). The Javascript also isn't enabled-- it's still broken, so I didn't feel comfortable showing it yet. Sorry! Thank you for taking the time to look at my site, and I'd love any feedback! The content pages of About and Pricing aren't available; same with the Javascript gallery, but the Contact form is 100% complete, so please test it!</p>
